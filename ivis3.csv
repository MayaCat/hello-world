Recently I have been thinking a lot about the importance of design in engineering in general, be it a physical object like a cell phone or something more abstract like a computer algorithm. Smooth, effective design is satisfying, and fits well in a sleek, wired, progressive culture such as that of Sweden.","I want to learn how to manipulate data into interactive, smooth-running informatics. It is something I have been interested in for a while, and to me it may be a useful skill in the future.",2,3,6,9,5,3,3,3,4,8,8,2,0,1
